- The value of fff controling how fast the probability decays beyond the buffer zone
- The value of ggg controling how fast the probability decays inside the buffer zone

(f = 0.5, g = 1)

Specifically, 
>We admit to have no idea why they need to be related, and cannot find a good explanation in Rossmoâ€™s novel of a dissertation. Instead, Rossmo claims both parameters should be equal. For the purposes of this blog we find their exact values irrelevant, and put them somewhere between a half and two thirds.

Future considerations:
- address `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in double_scalars` when using non-default values for `f` and `g` 
- radius / size of plot points 
- allow for user-defined approaches 
- allow for confidence of location, e.g. some of the disappearance locations are "last seen in the Seattle area" (Patricia Yellowrobe)
- allow user to define buffer _type_, e.g. min, max, etc.
- exclude water
