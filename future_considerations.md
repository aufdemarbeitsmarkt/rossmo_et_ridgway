# Future Considerations 

Future considerations:
- address `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in double_scalars` when using non-default values for `f` and `g` 
- radius / size of plot points 
- allow for user-defined approaches 
- allow for confidence of location, e.g. some of the disappearance locations are "last seen in the Seattle area" (Patricia Yellowrobe)

- exclude water 
- score based on unreasonableness of commute / commute times
    - e.g. it's unreasonable to expect a criminal to live in Port Townsend when the commute 
    - a buffer value of one mile demonstrates this well
    - Rossmo discusses this on 154 and 155
        - With no potential victims situated in the English Channel to
the south, he [Jose Rodrigues] was forced to confine his attacks to locations north of his residence,
which resulted in a distorted target pattern.
